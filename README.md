Scope of this mod:
- Add xenoptypes inspired by the [fantasy races of Faer√ªn](https://archive.org/details/races-of-faerun)

- Goblins, hobgoblins, and a tribal faction for them

## To-do:
- Add Vanilla Apparel Expanded tunic to elf syndicate pawnkind tags
- Flesh out factions with unique content
- - Mainly pawnkinds and raid compositions, not a bloated compendium of elf-themed crap
